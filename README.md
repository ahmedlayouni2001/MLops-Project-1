#  MLOps-Project-1

## Project Objective
Forecast hourly temperature using:
- 3 statistical models
- 1 ML model (to analyze its limitations for time series)
- 5 DL models

Using climate data API from 2020 to June 2025 (temperature and precipitation).

## Structure
- `data/`: raw and  processed data
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data collection, EDA, modeling, and evaluation.
- `models/`: saved models (statistical, ML, DL).
- `src/`: reusable scripts for ingestion, preprocessing, and training.
- `reports/`: figures and automated EDA reports.

## Tools
- Python 3.11 (via Anaconda)
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn, statsmodels
- tensorflow, pytorch
- mlflow for experiment tracking
